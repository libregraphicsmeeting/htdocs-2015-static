		<h3 class="schedule_title">Creating textbook-grade SVG illustrations for Wikipedia</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Hi! I am an SVG artist who produces CC vector illustrations to illustrate Wikipedia articles. Other wikimedians who have gone to LGM in the past have suggested that I give a talk at LGM about my work, since this is a rather new thing for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, as these projects have typically been stronger in text and photography. My illustrations have received dozens of awards from Wikimedia Commons, and I would like to give a talk about producing and contributing them. My Commons SVG portfolio can be found at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kelvinsong/Portfolio.<br>
I believe that this would be a valuable talk, because SVG is typically associated with HTML drawing and low-level technical diagrams, and there are few examples of the format being used for anything more sophisticated than graphs, schematics, and simple drawings, or more meaningful than proof-of-concept artistic renditions of cars or anime figures. I would like to tell people how SVG can be used to provide high quality textbook-level illustrations, and get more SVG artists involved in illustrating Wikipedia.<br><br>I am an American vector artist and type designer, who works exclusively in Inkscape, Blender, Fontforge etc and other free/open source apps. I have been contributing SVG illustrations to the wikimedia project for about two years, and at the time of writing, 31 of my images have made Commons Featured Picture status. One of the images I was also paid to write a tutorial for on VectorTuts (http://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/use-blender-and-inkscape-to-create-a-titans-atmosphere-infographic--vector-22221). I also do a lot of type design, and I used to do a lot of 3D art and animation in Blender.<br><br><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kelvinsong/Portfolio">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kelvinsong/Portfolio</a></p>

Through The List, organizations will provide lists of locations, people, and events that they need photographs of. And when users are in the right place at the right time, they can claim an item from the list and publish a photograph of it. <br>

		<p class="schedule_summary">imgflo is a image processing server with a HTTP API,<br>
using GEGL and node.js. Images are processed on-demand<br>
by accessing an URL which specifies the input image,<br>
operations to perform and associated parameters.<br>

imgflo uses the Flowhub visual programming IDE to allow<br>
image processing pipelines to be developed using<br>
a visual, interactive, node-based editor.<br>
The pipelines can then be deployed to the server,<br>
or one can use them in other GEGL-based applications<br>
- including GIMP.<br>
<br>
The talk will cover motivation for an image processing server,<br>
possible uses, and demo current capabilities.<br>

		<p class="schedule_summary">This presentation will review Sri Lankan graphic design as a Case Study for the role of Libre Graphics tools and practices in the developing world. I work with a group of friends as a design studio / collective (mooniak.com) and we started using libre tools, mainly Inkscape / FontForge  for our design work around a year back. I will use some of the projects we do at mooniak.com to demonstrate my points. Over the last year we managed to work with clients to do their design projects and then publish the content under CC licenses. Each distinctive culture needs stock images, icons and fonts relevant to that culture. A proprietary model has not provided those design assets to the small market in Sri Lanka. Convincing clients to make projects libre is not easy. We have a simple model, clients get a discount if they wish to go libre. We can give a better price, because we don’t have the overheads (We work from home) software costs, and because we use open content.The other aspect I will focus is challenges that we faced in migrating as a group, coming from different backgrounds. And wrap up with few thoughts on why developing world is a better playground for Libre Graphics Tools.<br><br>Pathum Egodawatta is a Graphic Designer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, who graduated from the Academy of Design, Colombo with a 1st Class BA Graphic Design degree in 2013, topping the batch.

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Why are black plums red when they are green?</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Ten years later, the Libre Graphics ecosystem has become a galaxy made of a large number of projects that nourish it. This Galaxy develops because we help each other to grow. Going beyond with Libre Graphics involves sharing our practices with people who are not designers, programmers, artists or developers - with those who have not yet taken off.<br>
<br>
In February 2015, Gráfica Liebre is launching an open women’s group called The Plums which will meet on a weekly basis. A space for thinking, learning and producing with Libre Tools and open practices in a feminist atmosphere. The aim is to share our knowledge regarding visual language with women who are interested, in order to broaden their capacity to read and produce, while promoting the Libre Graphics outlook amongst the <br>
female population. Working as a group and learning through practice, participants will become lucid and active visual readers and producers.<br>
<br>
Given the time frame, this talk doesn’t present achievements, but rather aims to share the project in its initial stages and seeks to obtain valuable feedback from the Toronto meeting that can contribute to the successful development of this experience.<br><br>Myriam Cea (Madrid, Spain, 1975). I've always been interested in Arts and creativity; it's for that that I studied Sculpture (Escuela de Artes y Oficios La Palma, Madrid. 1997-2000), Engraving (Escola superior de disseny i art Llotja. Barcelona. 1995-2000), and finally Graphic Design (Escuela Superior de Diseño, Madrid. 2009-2013).<br>
Among other professional activities related to design and its promotion, I'd been in charge of the Libre Graphics WorkStation in Medialab-Prado Madrid the last two years. At the same time I concived the idea of forming a working group on open source tools and practices. Today this group has become in an Association for Open Design and a graphic design studio, the first one that works exclusively whit libre tools in Madrid. We called it Gráfica Liebre, curretly leaded by Beatriz F. Estévez and myself.<br><br><a href="http://www.graficaliebre.com">http://www.graficaliebre.com</a></p>

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Allowing Mistakes to Happen</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Glitch art is the aestheticisation of digital or analogue errors, such as artefacts and other ''bugs'', by either corrupting digital code/data, misusing software, or by physically manipulating electronic devices. In cases where software is misused to create glitch art artists will work with software that allow mistakes and misuse to happen, for example, by importing image data into the Audacity audio editor.<br>
<br>
GIMP, Inkscape Scribus and their proprietary counterparts are promoted as facilitating creativity. However, these programs and many others often return errors when dealing with the corrupted data made through the glitching process. Should the software be doing this? Does refusing to attempt to interpret this data limit the creative output of these artists?<br>
<br>
In this presentation I will present my own work and experiences of creating art through errors. I will share commonly used techniques and discuss the relevance of glitch art in the wider design and art world. My intention is to present the case to developers to allow mistakes to happen and to artists to incorporate errors into their work.<br><br>Antonio Roberts is a new-media artist and curator based in Birmingham, UK.

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Accessible Graphics on the Web</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Are your graphics accessible to all audiences? This presentation introduces key concepts and methods behind accessibility.  It focuses on SVG on the web, but many ideas have broader applications, to the graphics you create and the tools you create them with.  <br>
<br>
The talk will address the following questions:<br>
- What does it mean for content to be accessible? Using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards, we ask: is it perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust?<br>
- How can graphics be accessible?  It depends on their purpose: What information should they communicate?  How should they be interactive?<br>
- How does SVG support accessibility? It features structured content, readable text, interactive links, and alternative text.<br>
- How can accessible graphics be improved?  Web accessibility tools now support advanced interaction and document navigation using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, but ARIA 1 did not emphasize graphics.<br>
- What is being done now?  The W3C's SVG Accessibility Task Force is helping integrate ARIA and SVG, and providing guidance on best practices.<br>
- How will this impact non-SVG graphics?  Annotated markup can be used in hidden fallback content for HTML Canvas graphics, and could be integrated in other XML-based vector graphics and charts.<br><br>Amelia Bellamy-Royds is an invited expert member of the W3C's SVG Working Group, active in the SVG Accessibility Task Force.  She is the co-author of SVG Essentials, 2nd Edition (with J. David Eisenberg) and the forthcoming Using SVG with CSS3 and HTML5 (with Kurt Cagle).<br>
<br>

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Creating realtime collaborative web applications with Derby.js and Meteor.js</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">The technologies needed to create realtime collaborative web applications have recently become much more accessible to web developers. Realtime web applications allow users to modify values without having to submit forms and/or reload the page, and any changes made by one user are propagated to other users—without them needing to reload the page either. While the software industry’s uptake of such techniques has been largely driven by the popularity of social network type applications, the mechanims work very well to create collaborative creative applications.<br>
<br>
Two popular frameworks, Meteor.js and Derby.js, provide solutions for the synchronisation and data binding required to make such applications function. Eric will introduce these two frameworks and their respective strength and show how they are used within OSP. Eric details the creation of Ethertoff.js (with Derby.js) and demos the creation of a collaborative font drawing tool (with Meteor.js).<br><br>OSP makes graphic design using only free and open source software. A caravan of practitioners from diverse fields, they design, program, research and teach. Working for print and web and its hybrids, OSP creates visual identities and digital utilities, always digging for a more intimate relation with the tool.  <br>

		<p class="schedule_summary">In the last year, Brussels-based design collective Open Source Publishing has used HTML to create printed publications. Some of them were only published in print, while others were hybrid publications appearing both in print and on-line or as slideshows. Some of these publications were built from scratch and others used the experimental CMS Ethertoff. In all cases a number of tools were needed to facilitate the transition from the screen to the printed page.<br>
<br>
    In this talk OSP will showcase a number of projects: the visual identity for the Brussels Balsamine theatre, the hybrid publication ‘Are you being Served’ that serves to document both online and in print the epynomous conference, and the art and theory periodical f-u-t-u-r-e.org.

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Libre fonts for Tamil</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Globalization has led to the need for multi-script and multi-lingual typography with demands for wide script coverage, comprehensive type-families that allow typographic differentiation in scripts that have not developed a tradition for this. The type and typography of some cultures and scripts have been more invested in than others, causing a gap in typographic standards. One such interesting gap are the features of a typeface family or system of typefaces that allow typographic differentiation. Complicating the issue further is the fact that some scripts have not developed a tradition to support this kind of differentiation. In display contexts there is also a demand for highly expressive vernacular type with a range of qualities and feelings found in the vast number of type styles available for the Latin script. These are  the serious challenges for a script like Tamil. At a micro design level the contrasting angular and circular forms with a lot of counter spaces are a challenge to harmonize. At the macro level, there is regional user preference for slanted type in body text or text for extended reading in India, and a diaspora community which may prefer an upright or un-slanted style. This talk will delve into these issues and speculate what steps are required for the moment.<br><br>Pria is interested in the problem solving aspect of design. Being a native of Chennai, India, the typographic standards of Tamil led her to pursue an MA in Typeface Design at the University of Reading. She consults for URW++, Monotype &amp; Google. Libre fonts are a natural extension of her interests in Indic Type-Design, as it is an effective platform that aids the transition of scripts into the digital future.</p>

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Marshall McLuhan Archive - Archive Sprint</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">The Hybrid Publishing Consortium (HPC) is an Open Source publishing infrastructure research group and proposes a session on ‘Publishing from Archives’ based on the Marshall McLuhan fonds in Library &amp; Archives Canada, in Ottawa. The archive contains video, audio, manuscripts and  experimental transmedia work of Marshall McLuhan himself. <br>
We use an Open Source tool chain of; Pando.ra (video archives), Tamboti - Heidelberg Research Architecture (collection management. Cluster Asia Europe, Heidelberg University) and famo.us (3D, GUI interface), Amara (video sub-titling. Participatory Culture Foundation) and Transpect (multi-format publishing. le-tex, Leipzig). <br>
With this tool set we allow users to author a data enrichment layer on-top of the existing collection data, allowing the public to become archivists and share their knowledge and insights. We use the model of the Book Sprints, but instead use transmedia content (video, audio, text, annotation etc) to create a trace on the archive or a new publication.<br>
This ‘Archive Sprint’ user layer on the archive creating a rich visual and auditory interface, secondly it leaves a new data source on the archive which is VRA, MODS meta description US Library of Congress compliant.<br>
The objective is to allow users to move from a light experience of creating ‘playlists’, to authoring on the involved level of Wikipedia. At the same time ensuring the data structure created is machine readable and so re-usable for—visual styling, citation, annotation, distribution and metrics etc.<br>
This project remixes a lecture given by Graham Larkin in 2011 in Berlin.<br>
<br><br>Christina Kral:  As part of a transdisciplinary research team, Kral explores the future of publishing in relation to open educational technologies. In particular, Kral researches forms of communication and engagement, learning habits and routines and develops transitional platforms and encounters that push publishing beyond normal conventions.

		<p class="schedule_summary">With the invention of movable-type in 1450, writing became type-setting. Where a letters' shape used to be the result of the movement of hand and pen it became a meticoulously designed outline ready to be copied millions of times in mass-production. Writing turned into typograhy. Instead of transferring the skeleton: the gesture. We transfer it's facade.  And so, for more than five centuries, typography has been kept away from the potential of writing.<br>
    In the progression of typography from punch cutting through to font design software we've ported over old physical constraints to digital canvases, canvasses that are really much more flexible than what we are currently using them as. Partly because of the typographer himself, feeling the custodian of a very long tradition, the constraints and economics of production but also for the convenience of the major software publishers already struggling in trying to manage and cover all of the world's  writing systems. OSP continues to emphasize this issue and would like to present the work, experiments and paths we've explored around this issue by showing (stroke-)fonts we've drawn but more importantly the tools we have and are developing to reclaim the potential in typography.<br><br>OSP makes graphic design using only free and open source software.

		<p class="schedule_summary">This session has two halves. First, I will present my work on two personal font-development tools: one is a command-line utility for automatically building installable release packages (in RPM, Deb, CTAN, and Zip format) of font families, and the other is a set of Emacs Major Modes for editing font files with syntax highlighting, auto-indent, and tokenization.  The packaging tool adresses an area often overlooked in open font development: rolling a release. The Emacs modes make it easier to edit and debug font source files. Hopefully both tools will help make some well-tested methods from software development more useful in type design.<br>
<br>
Second, I'll discuss the recent effort announced on CREATE to develop and implement GUI UX patterns for accessing OpenType features, and why it's important to free software.  OpenType substitution and positioning features are one of the format's major selling points to type designers, but they have poor support in creative applications.

Three years ago I began Crafting Type, a collective and co-operative project to offer short type design introduction workshops around the world, using only libre graphics tools. Around that time the FontForge founder, George Williams, stepped away from the project to pursue other hobbies, so I stepped up to organise the development that I found Crafting Type participants asking for. Despite fixing many crashes and bugs and attempts to add brave new features, last year I became disheartened at the rate of progress. I began considering what an ideal libre font editor ought to be, and how to make it happen.

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Using Tangibles for pre-production</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Traditionally, the pre-production pipeline starts with a script, and then the director develops concept art for each scene described in the script either on paper or in digital form.  Following this stage, the director then works closely with an animator on a pre-visualization utilizing animation software (e.g. Autodesk Maya).  The developed scene is visualized in a crude form using placeholder assets, but this crude visualization provides the director with information about the placement of actors/cameras/lights/objects enabling them to quickly try out new ideas, different lighting characteristics, and different cinematographic techniques.  Once completed, a cinematographer is employed to determine the proper camera motions, placements, and provide critique on this initial design.  The design process ensues with the director and cinematographer discussing necessary changes and through a series of compromises the scene is finalized and can be produced.  This pipeline works for both animated and live-action pre-production, however due to the sheer number of people involved throughout the pre-production stage in defining the scene parameters, the director’s overall creative vision can easily be lost in the process.  <br>

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Stroke-Fonts — open call for a standard?</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Although we are convinced about the portential of stroke-fonts actually using them, while keeping their flexibility, is challenging. At the moment the best we can do to streamline the usage process is to freeze a version of the stroke at a set thickness, then outline it, building it back for use in current font formats. Especially on the web with it's dynamic potential this feels like a big loss. We look at the engineering that built DIN, Dr Hershey, Donald Knuth, Adobe Type 3 and SVG3 both with awe and equal frustration. <br>
<br>
Could their be a way to integrate a stroke font format in to publishing software? A new definition of how lettershapes are described for them to be able to be used easily? Can we imagine a type-setting system that doesn't precompile glyphs shape, but renders them inline, so themselve glyphs can become responsive? We will take a look at the existing standards, but also the more experimental-tools, some of which OSP is working on, both for print and web-publication (and SVG3?).<br><br>OSP is a collective of graphic designers &amp; programmers using only free and open source software.

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Digital Steganography: A New File Type for 3D Models</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Digital Steganography is the practice of concealing one file type within another, such as text within in image (it is also a long-standing method of encryption used by security agencies...). In this presentation I will describe a novel method for encoding 3D geometric data within an image file that create a new, cross platform file type for 3D models. The X,Y, Z values of a triangulated mesh, such as would typically be described by an STL file, can be mapped, more or less, directly to the R,G,B values of a pixel within a simple PNG file. Once mapped, the data can be organised within the image in may novel ways that create a 2D representation whose data is, at the same time, both human and machine readable. Using a number of prototype tools, developed using the processing programming language, I will demonstrate the following;<br>
- Limitless opportunities for file encryption, using custom codes as well as image editing software.<br>
- New ways of tracking 'the diff' between various 3D models files that are enabled by this new file format.<br>
- Improvements in file compression when compared to other 3D file formats.<br><br>I am an architect and computational designer based in London and I am a PhD candidate at the Sheffield School of Architecture (SSoA) where my research is concerned with the agency of software and its social production within the field of architectural design.

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Using Open Source to Teach Critical and Creative Thinking</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">Over the past ten years I have been steadily increasing the amount of open source software I utilize in my design courses. I now believe I can teach digital media courses exclusively with free and open source software and not impair my students' chances of gainful employment. In fact, my students are better artists and designers directly because of their experience with open source tools. They are more versatile, easily adapt to change, and have a greater capacity to tinker with their tools. This presentation will be about the open source paradigm and its effect in the classroom. I will show how teaching with free and open source is a way to teach students the ability to learn software more efficiently and quickly, and inspire greater curiosity. Open source software not only makes students' portfolios more diverse and professional, it makes them better thinkers. <br>
<br>
Presently, I am leading an initiative at my college, SUNY Buffalo State, to adopt more open source tools. I will discuss my experience in adopting this software in the classroom. I will also discuss the opposition and controversy from colleagues that I have encountered by using software that &ldquo;is not industry standard&rdquo;.<br><br>Brent Patterson has been teaching animation, interactive design, and visual effects at several colleges and universities since 2002.

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Making- Become a Maker with open source software</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">The aim of my presentation is to talk about my inspiration of the maker scene and to showcase my project I developed in an open source environment. I created a dress with LEDs soldered onto the fabric building a special compound and a flexible circuit. The layout has been done with graphical open software like inkscape and gimp and is then printed with conductive ink to the fabric. I used Arduino software and microcontroller for making smart clothes to include LEDs and Accelerometer. <br>
<br>
The created pattern work can be used either for fabric printing, laser cutting or even for sending to a hacked knitting machine to get an individual, customized style, fulfilling the aim that we can download and print clothes to start our own production. The creative culture and the use of free formats make it usable for further development.  Tinkering in an open digital fabrication studio e.g. Fablab.<br>
I plan to prepare a library of design content such as pattern printing, swatches pattern work, accessible under cc licensing. <br>
To participate, exchange, explore, cooperate and show contribution, free access of knowledge is important. Therefore we share skills and knowledge in the community e.g. by launching The Fashion Tec Group where people come to present their projects. <br>
Also different ideas have been presented at Meshcon and Wear it Conference and openXlab in Berlin.<br><br>I studied Product Development in Clothing and come from a classical fashion background. I worked for a clothing company. In 2009, I start to explore new Technology including LEDs in cloth, but it was not so easy to get a lot of information about it. During my research, especially the big Designers were at the forefront to market new Technology features. Although, there were only prototypes or couture pieces, they showed something new. Now, a lot of knowledge has been shared and during the codemotion in Berlin, I attended a workshop to learn about Arduino programming. Since then, I improved my skills in creative coding and eTextile. Also, I am part of the Fashion Tec Working group in Berlin to build a community of people to share their knowledge.<br><br><a href="http://www.meetup.com/FashionTec-Meetup-Berlin/">http://www.meetup.com/FashionTec-Meetup-Berlin/</a></p>

		<h3 class="schedule_title">OpenGL in LibreOffice</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">LibreOffice uses its own GUI and rendering toolkit called VCL that works across every major PC platform and even a few mobile platforms. On Linux it provides backends for Gtk and Qt. To make use of modern graphics hardware the LibreOffice project decided to add a cross-platform backend that still provides support for different GUI toolkits. <br>
<br>
Using OpenGL allows us to improve the performance of our rendering by moving the work from the CPU to the mostly unused GPU. It also provides us with fast image scaling allowing us to use better scaling algorithms while still supporting fast scrolling. Together with the fact that OpenGL allows us to innovate without being limited by the ancient rendering APIs provided by different systems, makes porting our rendering toolkit to OpenGL an attractive option.<br>
<br>
Come and see how the LibreOffice embraced this challenge and implemented the new VCL OpenGL backend that is being shipped in LibreOffice 4.4.<br><br>Markus is studying Mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institue for Techonoology and works part time on LibreOffice for Collabora.

Our strategy since the beginning has been to develop communities to produce high quality free manuals about Free Software in their own language. Today, through the use of Booksprints and federated publishing techniques we have more than 120 books in more than 30 languages and more than 4,000 contributors. <br>
<br>
FLOSS Manuals is more than a collection of manuals about doing things with free and open source software, it is also the community. The contributors include designers, readers, writers, illustrators, free software fans, editors, artists, software developers, activists, and many others. Anyone can contribute to a manual – to fix a spelling mistake, add a more detailed explanation, write a new chapter, or start a whole new manual on a topic.<br>
<br>
FLOSS Manuals now consists of 3 independent language communities (French, English, Finnish) supported by a Foundation based in Holland. Our current focus is to develop strong partnerships with grassroots educators to develop educational materials about free software.<br>

		<h3 class="schedule_title">Ten years of Pitivi (and of libre video editing in general)</h3>
		<p class="schedule_summary">&ldquo;LGM 2015: Beyond The First Decade&rdquo; has a special meaning for the Pitivi community, as this leading GStreamer-based video editor recently celebrated its own 10th anniversary.<br>
<br>
In this talk, we will look at changes in the motion graphics landscape in recent years (shifts in filmmaking hardware and production pace,<br>
computing power, means of distribution, etc.), take a moment to marvel at the progress we have made thus far (esp. from the Pitivi side), and another moment to ponder the herculean task that remains before us in order to remain relevant for the next decade.<br>
<br>
This talk is intended to be less technical, touching on subjects such as heavy trends in the industry, FLOSS project management, economics, etc. All are welcome!<br>
<br>
In addition to this presentation, interested parties may join us afterwards for an ad-hoc yet intensive testing session to weed out remaining bugs for the upcoming Pitivi 1.0 release.<br>

Its lengthy title, _I think that conversations are the best, biggest thing that Free Software has to offer its user_, is taken from an interview with Debian developer Asheesh Laroia. His remark points at the difference that Free Software can make when users are invited to consider, interrogate and discuss not only the technical details of software, but its concepts and histories as well. 'Conversations' is edited by Femke Snelting and Christoph Haag. The publication is published by Constant and produced collaboratively, using a custom Libre Graphics workflow developed by Christoph Haag.<br><br>Christoph Haag studied design at the Department of Hybrid Space/Academy of Media Arts Cologne.
